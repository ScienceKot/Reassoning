# Reassoning
This repository have my projects of reassoning development in AI systems

#AND_OR_TREE
This project is the first implimentation of reassoning in AI systems. This project is consisting of 3 main components:
* The matrix environment - A matrix where are some number of blocks, each taking a cell.
* The AND_OR_TREE - A list like data structure, which saves all the actions taken by the agent in matrix environment. It allso is used to answer to the user's questions.
* The terminal - A special terminal that allows the user interact with the agent by sking questions about it's behavior.

Also there are 2 types of questions that the agent can answer to:
* "WHY you did that?"
* "HOW did you did it?"
